Twitter Text Sentiment Analysis
===============================

**Needs to be updated for Twitter API v 1.1**

Accompanying data files for this Youtube video - [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adIvt_luO1o ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adIvt_luO1o )

This video details how to conduct text sentiment analysis in R using Jeffrey Bean's [algorithm](http://jeffreybreen.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/twitter-text-mining-r-slides/). 

Essentially, I show how to pull tweets from the Twitter web API, comparing each word to positive and negative word bank, and then using a basic algorithm to determine the overall sentiment. I also show how to analyze the data. 

This repository includes the algorithm, word banks, output, and R data.
